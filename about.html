                    <p>Im known for many things in my private life. Some good, some 
                        bad. "Energic Volunteer", "Furry Ambassador", 
                        "The Pianist", "The Wierdo", and "The Attention Seeker"
                        are some of them. The important question is how <strong>you
                        </strong> want to percieve me as.

                    <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                    <p>I am a 26 year old student, currently enrolled at 
                        <span title="Norwegian University of 
                        Science and Technology">NTNU</span> in Master of Industrial 
                        Innovation and Digital Security. I am expected to graduate
                        at summer 2026. I am a higly energetic person with big 
                        ambitions for the future!
                    </p>
                    <p>I have an unique hobby during the freetime. I am actively 
                        engaged in the Furry community, and after only a few years 
                        I have managed to be one of the most foremost furries in 
                        Norway. My furry characther (fursona) is named Kunai. It is
                        a cute fox doing silly things. I also have a costume 
                        (fursuit) of my characther. With that, i can bring my 
                        passion about this hobby and at the same time bring smiles 
                        to people's faces, and giving them something truely magical 
                        and unique
                    </p>

                    <p>Other than that, I am also heavily invested in Volunteer 
                        Work. During my studies, I have been in several student 
                        organizations at the campus as well as the city's volunteer 
                        centre. My work to improve the student welfare, events, and
                        and even at the volunteer centre has been recognised. As a 
                        result, I have been awarded The Volunteer of The Year 2023 
                        at the Students House, and a signed diploma by the city's 
                        Mayor for my contribution!
