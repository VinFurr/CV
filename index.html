                        <h2>Electronics Engineer</h2>
                        <p>Graduating spring 2024 from NTNU with a Bachelor's 
                            degree in Electronics Engineering. My interests are in 
                            computers, hardware, FPGA, programming, web development
                            and similar, and I would like to learn more within these 
                            areas. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In addition to my academic background, I have also been an 
                            active volunteer at several student organizations, as well 
                            as the local volunteer central. This has strengthened my 
                            abilities to plan events and cooperate with others.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am always hungry for new challenges and opportunities 
                            which lets me evolve my skills and knowledge to an another 
                            level, and use my skills to make a positive impact within 
                            technology and innovation.
