                        <p>I have been studying the basics 
                            of electrical installations. I have learned the 
                            basics of how electrical home installations, 
                            electronic systems, and automated systems work. Some
                            of the experiences I have gained include learning how to build a small 
                            scale electrical installation, using instruments to 
                            evaluate the installation, building a system using 
                            3-phase motors, and planning an alarm system.
