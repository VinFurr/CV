                   <h2>lies, Lies, LIES!</h2>
                   <p>Why do humans lie? a "white lie" I understand, but I believe lies generally causes more harm than good. 
                    Lying with <i>bad intention</i> is something I despite and hate. It has no place in an inclusive society!</p>
                    <p>  Due to my condition and values, I have have a hard time lying and are i most situations unable to lie. 
                    This however can actually be a good thing! I am an honest person and show the world the real me. However
                           I can at times be too direct with my choice of words and it has caused some people to dislike me as they 
                           mayhaps percieved me as rude. <br>Just remember that I will <strong>always try to be honest!</strong> 
                        </p>
